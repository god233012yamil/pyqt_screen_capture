# PyQt Screen Capture Tool

This project is a screen or region capture tool written in Python using the libraries PyQt5 and win32gui.

The library PyQt5 is used to create the GUI while the library win32gui is used to capture the screen
or a region from any available display.

This tool is similar than the snipping tool from windows. You can choose a region of the screen and copy to the
clipboard for further use. It also allows to save the image to file.
