# PyQt Screen Capture Tool

This project is a screen or region capture tool written in Python using the libraries PyQt5 and win32gui.

PyQt5 is used to create the GUI for the application, and the library win32gui is used to capture the screen
or a region in a multidisplay setup.

This tool is similar than the snipping tool from windows. You can choose a region of the screen and copy to the
clipboard for further use.
