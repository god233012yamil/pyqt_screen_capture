# Overview

This project is a screen or region capture tool written in Python using mainly the libraries PyQt5 and win32gui.

The library PyQt5 is used to create the GUI while the library win32gui is used to capture the screen
or a region from any available display.

This tool is similar to the snipping tool from windows. You can choose a region of the screen and copy it to the
clipboard for further use. It also allows you to save the image to a file.

To select a region of the screen press the mouse left button while moving. The mouse must be placed inside the 
red dashed square or transparent window.

The red dashed square or transparent windows can be resized by placing the mouse over the edge, then pressing
the left button while moving in or out. It can also be resized by doing the same procedure over the corner.
